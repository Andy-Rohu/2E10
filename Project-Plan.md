2E10 Project Plan
Group Y02

**Overall Group Objective**
Our objective for this project is for each member to complete a buggy that meets the Bronze challenge requirements, and choose the fastest buggy to develop further to pass the Silver and Gold challenges. Each member will work on smaller tasks, the progress of which will be discussed at weekly meetings. All completed tasks for the bronze challenge will be added to each member’s buggy while tasks for the silver and gold challenges will be added only to the chosen buggy.

**Project Schedule**

If a member has finished their task early or has not been assigned a task for a certain week, they will help with other tasks wherever needed. Each member will attempt the lab work prior to the labs each week and we will meet as a group to discuss and help with any issues.

**Risk Assessment**
Risk	Chance	Impact	C * I	Contingency

Team member is ill	            1	2	2	    Regular contact in the group chat. Comment all code. Help with completing assigned tasks.
Hardware breaks	                2	2	4	    Use a back-up buggy and request a new part.
Fall behind on milestones 	    3	3	9	    Reassess plan. Figure out where we are falling behind and assign other team members to help.
Issues with software	          3	2	6	    Discuss and research as a group and then contact a TA if still unsolved
A team member is struggling 
with assigned task	            3	3	9	    Set up meetings to help. Add another member to work on the task. Switch tasks if necessary.
A team member is unable to 
attend a meeting	              2	2	4	    Notes of the decisions made in the meeting should be posted into the group chat. Check to make sure the team member is doing okay                                           with their current task
A member has heavy workload
in other modules	              2	3	6	    Assign another team member to help with their task. Might need to switch tasks to a less demanding one.
Code is lost or changed 
without back-up	                2	4	8	    Save code and upload to the drive regularly.


**Communication Plan**

Project Leader - Andy Rohu
Throughout this project, our group will be having weekly meetings on Thursdays from 12:00 – 1:00pm. Our aim is to have attempted both lab sessions for the coming week before our meeting, and then to discuss any issues or problems we might have had. During the meeting we will also check in with how everyone is doing on their current task and if anyone needs help. This will help ensure that we remain on track with our project plan. 
We have also set up a group chat on Messenger to keep in regular contact and talk about any smaller issues that people have or need help with. The group chat will also make it easier to organize extra meetings if necessary.
A shared drive has been created to share all our code and keep it organised. This will enable us to work on code together more easily and will also reduce the risk of code being lost or accidentally changed without back-up. The drive will also be used to store all of our pictures taken throughout the process, which will make things easier when it comes time to write the interim and final reports.
